There are many reasons I'm making this career change. For one thing, I love learning, and I'm really enjoying building a new skill set. Secondly, this is a growing field that will allow me long term flexibility and opportunity. And finally, I love the idea of getting into a field that I wouldn't previously have felt was accessible to me as a woman. I had a female role model show me that this was something I could do, and I'd love to be that role model for another woman someday.
